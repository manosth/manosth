### Hi, I'm Manos! ðŸ‘‹

I am a 5th year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, working with <a href="http://www.demba-ba.org">Demba Ba</a>. In the past I interned at Amazon AWS under the tutelage of <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=mwv4j0gAAAAJ&hl=en">Karim Helwani</a> and graduated with a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, where I completed my thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A2XydgGCY9gC&hl=en">Petros Maragos</a>.

These days I'm mainly interested in theoretically deriving and understanding deep learning representations. The work that is most representative of my current interests is this one on <a href="https://github.com/manosth/cyclical_groups">learning equivariant representations</a>.
